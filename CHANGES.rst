Changelog
=========

2.3.0 (20??-??-??)
------------------

- Provide the ``-T`` or ``--test-only`` flag to the ``karma`` runtime to
  allow toolchain execution be terminated after the tests are executed
  regardless of outcome.  This would generally allow the test to run
  without forcing the toolchain to build the artifact.  [
  `#11 <https://github.com/calmjs/calmjs.dev/issues/11>`_
  ]

2.2.2 (2018-08-17)
------------------

- Configuration writers that write out karma configuration scripts that
  import other Node.js modules that are present within the environment
  that the karma binary reside in should no longer encounter a ``Error:
  Cannot find module`` message.  [
  `#10 <https://github.com/calmjs/calmjs.dev/issues/10>`_
  ]
- Permit the use of other karma_conf dict/mapping types in the spec.  [
  `#9 <https://github.com/calmjs/calmjs.dev/issues/9>`_
  ]

2.2.1 (2018-08-01)
------------------

- Allow the karma configuration writer to be specified in the spec, such
  that it may be overridden by framework integration packages.  [
  `#8 <https://github.com/calmjs/calmjs.dev/issues/8>`_
  ]

2.2.0 (2018-07-24)
------------------

- Support the correct resolution of test child module registries, which
  was introduced in ``calmjs-3.3.0``.  [
  `#6 <https://github.com/calmjs/calmjs.dev/issues/6>`_
  ]
- Ensure that a missing karma binary is also correctly dealt with by the
  same set of exception and flags.  [
  `#7 <https://github.com/calmjs/calmjs.dev/issues/7>`_
  ]

2.1.0 (2018-05-28)
------------------

- Ensure the exit code indicates failure if the artifact test entry
  point references an import that cannot be resolved (failure to set up
  the test must result in a failure). [
  `#3 <https://github.com/calmjs/calmjs.dev/issues/3>`_
  ]
- Make use of the corrected semantics provided by calmjs-3.1.0 for the
  deferred export location verification, which also silences the
  calmjs-4.0.0 deprecation warning. [
  `#5 <https://github.com/calmjs/calmjs.dev/issues/5>`_
  ]

2.0.0 (2018-01-10)
------------------

- Migration to the calmjs-3.0.0 API.
- Bumped a number of dependencies on Node.js packages.
- The paths that are covered by the test coverage report are now
  recorded in the Spec as part of the test execution workflow through
  the KarmaDriver.
- Provide framework and command for testing of predefined artifacts
  generated for packages defined through the ``calmjs.artifacts``
  registry; ``calmjs.artifacts.tests`` registry was created such that
  toolchain packages may declare the test compliment builder functions
  to facilitate testing for their dependent packages.
- Implemented ``--cover-report-type`` flag to support the specification
  of multiple coverage report types to be generated, and ensured that
  the defined report types actually work (a karma/istanbul bug was
  found and a workaround was implemented).
- A number of internal code refactor, i.e. a number of internal API
  changes have happened.
- Deprecated ``--coverage-type`` flag, as it is inconsistently named and
  that features provided by ``--cover-report-type`` superseded this.
- Deprecated ``--test-package`` flag in favor of ``--test-with-package``
  for more clarity about the intention of that flag.

1.1.0 (2017-08-10)
------------------

- Tests are now automatically wrapped by a default template when served
  by karma to better limit the scope of the variables defined within
  each file.  This can be disabled using ``--no-wrap-tests`` flag on the
  ``karma`` runtime.

1.0.3 (2017-05-22)
------------------

- Move the ``--artifact`` and ``--cover-artifact`` flag up to the main
  ``karma`` runtime to permit wider and more flexible usage for all
  runners.
- Correctly report the path of missing specified artifacts in the logs.

1.0.2 (2017-01-27)
------------------

- Provide test prefix key and constant.

1.0.1 (2016-11-30)
------------------

- Correct the inability to launch standard graphical browsers directly
  via the runner under Windows.

1.0.0 (2016-11-18)
------------------

- Initial release of the development support for the calmjs framework.
- Include karma test runner integration as a calmjs runtime that can
  accept calmjs toolchain runtimes to facilitate testing.
- Generation of test coverage reports of JavaScript sources executed.
- Leverage the toolchain advice system for adding the test runner and
  also permit the modification of test configurations by toolchain
  implementations that require specific instructions for a successful
  execution of tests.
- Permit integration with other packages for testing artifacts generated
  by other systems.
